# omghax Dotfiles

Shell scripts to set up a machine the way I like it.

## Installation

Copy and paste the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl https://raw.github.com/omghax/dotfiles/master/install.sh -L -o - | sh
```

Or, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/omghax/dotfiles.git ~/Dotfiles
```

Then run the `install.sh` script yourself:

```sh
~/Dotfiles/install.sh
```

## OS X Settings

There's an additional script, `osx.sh`, which will set up OS X system
preferences as well. To run it, clone the repository as detailed above, then
run:

```sh
~/Dotfiles/osx.sh
```
